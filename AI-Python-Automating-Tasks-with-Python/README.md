## ✅ AI Python for Beginners:Automating Tasks with Python    
An insight in  essential Python concepts like lists, loops, dictionaries, and booleans, and discover how they can enhance the way you organize and analyze data. Gain practical insights into leveraging these concepts in combination with Large Language Models (LLMs) to create intelligent and efficient solutions.  Learn to automate repetitive tasks and implement intelligent decision-making with code. Create AI-powered tools that can prioritize tasks, such as customizing recipes based on preferences, and making data-driven decisions.
