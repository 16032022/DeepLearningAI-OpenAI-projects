## AI Python for Beginners:Exstending Python with Packages and API
Learn how to extend Python’s capabilities using pre-written packages and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). You’ll learn how to use existing code solutions to common problems, saving time and effort in your programming. You’ll work with built-in modules, third-party packages, and online APIs to access a wide range of tools and data sources, including AI services. You’ll also learn how to install Python and Jupyter on your own computer, enabling you to continue your coding path beyond this course. By the end, you’ll have the skills to create more sophisticated programs and tap into the vast ecosystem of Python resources!
