    "CHATBOT : Unstructured data refers to information that does not have a predefined data model or easily organized framework. It lacks the structured format typically seen in relational databases and instead may consist of a wide variety of data types that are not easily stored or categorized in a table-like format (i.e., rows and columns). This makes unstructured data more challenging to process, analyze, and store in traditional systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics of Unstructured Data:\n",
    "No Fixed Schema or Format: Unlike structured data (e.g., database tables), unstructured data is free-form, meaning it doesn't conform to a rigid structure.\n",
    "Variety: It can include text, images, audio, video, social media posts, and more.\n",
    "Large Volume: It typically represents a significant portion of data generated by modern systems and is often stored in huge volumes.\n",
    "Difficult to Analyze: Since there is no standard schema, specialized tools like natural language processing (NLP), image recognition, and machine learning are often required to extract meaningful insights from unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Unstructured Data:\n",
    "Text: Emails, word processing documents (e.g., .doc files), PDFs, log files, social media posts (tweets, Facebook comments).\n",
    "Media Files: Audio files, video files, and image files (e.g., .mp3, .mp4, .jpeg).\n",
    "Web Content: HTML content from websites, blogs, wikis.\n",
    "Sensor Data: Data from IoT devices or machine-generated data that does not follow a clear format.\n",
    "Customer Feedback: Freeform responses in surveys or reviews."

       "For a more modern dining experience, I headed to Olympe in Lagoa. This Michelin-starred restaurant specializes in contemporary Brazilian cuisine. The highlight was their moqueca de caju (cashew nut stew). This rich and creamy stew, made from cashew nuts and complemented by fresh seafood and vegetables, was an exquisite dish in an elegant and refined setting.\n",

       "Finally, I concluded my culinary tour at AprazÃ­vel, renowned for its breathtaking views and farm-to-table approach. Their signature dish, galinhada (Brazilian chicken and rice), was outstanding. The tender and flavorful chicken, cooked with a mix of rice, vegetables, and spices, and served with farofa (toasted cassava flour), perfectly highlighted the fresh, locally sourced ingredients. The lush, garden-like setting of the restaurant provided a serene end to the culinary adventure.\n"
