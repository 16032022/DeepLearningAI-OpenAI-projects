    "## Introduction\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to `handle files in Python`. It covers essential file handling operations such as `reading from text files` and utilizing functions to interact with file contents. Additionally, you will learn `how to leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract and process information from text data`. By following along, you will gain practical experience in managing file data, enhancing your Python programming skills for data manipulation and automation tasks."
