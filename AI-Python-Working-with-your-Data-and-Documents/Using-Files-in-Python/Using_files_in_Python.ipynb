    "\n",
    "Bullet points are a formatting tool used to organize and present information in a clear, concise, and visually appealing way. They are often used in lists to highlight key points or summarize important details. Each item in the list is preceded by a symbol, usually a dot (‚Ä¢), although other symbols like dashes (-) or numbers can be used depending on the context or format.\n",

    "Concise: They are short and to the point, summarizing key information.\n",
    "Structured: Bullet points help structure information, making it easy to read and follow.\n",
    "Visually appealing: By breaking text into individual items, they make the content more digestible.\n",
    "Hierarchical: Sometimes, bullet points can be nested to show relationships between items, with sub-points appearing indented beneath main points.\n",
