    "## Introduction \n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore `how to use AI to extract specific information from journal entries written by food critics`. By utilizing a Language Learning Model (LLM), we can automatically identify and highlight important details such as restaurant names and their signature dishes. This approach helps in efficiently organizing and analyzing unstructured text data, making it easier to gain insights from large volumes of text. We will also demonstrate how to extract this information in various formats, such as highlighting within the text and listing it in a CSV format."

    "In this notebook, we demonstrated how to `use an LLM to extract and highlight important information from journal entries about restaurants and their signature dishes`. By iterating over multiple journal entries, we could efficiently organize and extract relevant information. This approach can be extended to various other classification and extraction tasks, making it a `versatile tool for working with unstructured text data`."

The fish, sourced from the Murray River, was perfectly cooked, with a crispy skin and tender, flaky flesh.
