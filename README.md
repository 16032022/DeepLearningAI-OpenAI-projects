Welcome to the OpenAI repository! This repository contains reviewed and personalized code examples inspired by four short courses offered on the [DeepLearning.AI platform](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) in collaboration with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/):

## AI Python for Beginners: Automatic Task with Python    
Learn how to automate repetitive tasks and make intelligent decisions using code. You’ll also learn essential Python concepts like lists, loops, and dictionaries and see how they can transform the way you handle and effectively use data. You’ll create AI-powered tools that can prioritize your tasks, customize recipes based on preferences, and make decisions based on data. By the end of this course, you’ll be writing Python programs that can tackle complex, real-world problems.
You have already seen how to work with lists, dictionaries, and booleans, and are familiar with how to use all of them with LLMs. 

## AI Python for Beginners: Working with your own Data and Document
Learn how to work with your own data and documents using Python. You’ll explore loading, manipulating, and saving data from various file formats, including unstructured text and structured CSV files. You’ll leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze and extract information from your data, automating complex tasks across multiple documents. By the end of the course, you’ll apply your skills to a real-world project, using Python and AI to plan a dream vacation with detailed itineraries for multiple destinations.

## AI Python for Beginners: Extending Python with Packages and API
Learn how to extend Python’s capabilities using pre-written packages and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). You’ll learn how to use existing code solutions to common problems, saving time and effort in your programming. You’ll work with built-in modules, third-party packages, and online APIs to access a wide range of tools and data sources, including AI services. You’ll also learn how to install Python and Jupyter on your own computer, enabling you to continue your coding path beyond this course. By the end, you’ll have the skills to create more sophisticated programs and tap into the vast ecosystem of Python resources!
learn how to extend the capabilities of Python using code written by other programmers!

## Building System with CHATGPT AI 
How to automate complex workflows using chain calls to a large language model in practical scenarios, including classifying user queries to a chat agent’s response, evaluating user queries for safety, and processing tasks for chain-of-thought, multi-step reasoning. 

## ❓ What's Inside
