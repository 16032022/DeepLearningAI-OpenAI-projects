Welcome to the OpenAI repository! This repository contains reviewed and personalized code examples inspired by four short courses offered on the [DeepLearning.AI platform](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) in collaboration with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/):

## AI Python for Beginners: Automating Tasks with Python    
An insight in  essential Python concepts like lists, loops, dictionaries, and booleans, and discover how they can enhance the way you organize and analyze data. Gain practical insights into leveraging these concepts in combination with Large Language Models (LLMs) to create intelligent and efficient solutions.  Learn to automate repetitive tasks and implement intelligent decision-making with code. Create AI-powered tools that can prioritize tasks, such as customizing recipes based on preferences, and making data-driven decisions.

## AI Python for Beginners: Working with Your Own Data and Documents Python
Learn how to work with your own data and documents using Python. Explore loading, manipulating, and saving data from various file formats, including unstructured text and structured CSV files. Leverage the power of LLMs to analyze and extract information from your data, automating complex tasks across multiple documents. Apply your skills to a real-world project, using Python and AI to plan a dream vacation with detailed itineraries for multiple destinations.

## AI Python for Beginners: Extending Python with Packages and APIs!
Learn how to extend Python’s capabilities using pre-written packages and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Learn how to use existing code solutions to common problems, saving time and effort in your programming. Work with built-in modules, third-party packages, and online APIs to access a wide range of tools and data sources, including AI services. Have the skills to create more sophisticated programs and tap into the vast ecosystem of Python resources! Learn how to extend the capabilities of Python using code written by other programmers!

## Building Systems with ChatGPT API 
How to automate complex workflows using chain calls to a large language model in practical scenarios, including classifying user queries to a chat agent’s response, evaluating user queries for safety, and processing tasks for chain-of-thought, multi-step reasoning.
